# LeetCode-75

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the [**LeetCode 75**](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) study plan.
<br />
File names follow the format `ID. Title.ext`.

## Build & Run

Most files do not include a `main` function since the LeetCode platform provides the driver code. For local testing, you can add a small `main`.

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic "1768. Merge Strings Alternately.cpp" -o merge && ./merge
```
